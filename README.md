HashPash is a tool for securely encrypting users' text and files.

This program encrypts users' chosen text or files using a hybrid encryption model. After encryption, you can send the hashed code to your intended recipient, who can then use the Pash section of the program to decrypt and view your message or file.

Usage Guide: You can generate your public and private keys using the RSA algorithm through the Generate Key tab. Share your public key with the person who will send you the confidential message or file, so they can enter your public key in the public key field and encrypt the message or file.

After encryption, a hash code will be provided in the hash field along with an encrypted file with the .hped extension. You can securely share the hash code and the encrypted .hped file with the intended recipient. With their private key, the hash code, and the encrypted file, they will be able to decrypt and view the message or file.

## Note: The private key is used for decryption and is automatically entered in the Pash section of the program. Never share your private key with anyone.

## Our purpose in creating this program: To encrypt confidential text or files on your system, as well as to securely encrypt and send text or files to an intended recipient in a fully encrypted and safe manner.

We strive to develop security applications to fill the gap left by today's society, which often overlooks security.
